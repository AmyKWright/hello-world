Here's to making the right sort of mistakes.

After all, I'm still following my new mantra.
You have to suck before you can be mediocre,
You have to be mediocre before you can be competent,
You have to be competent before you can be good,
You have to be good before you can be great.

Here's to attempting greatness.
